# Bit-Vision
A Glitch art tool based around pixel sorting. Bit Vision allows users to select their preferred sorting algorithm, sorting criteria(called 'comparator' on the app), directional increments, threshold, and magnitude. The program operates in real time, allowing an image to be sorted with different settings applied one after another to create unique effects.

Future updates will likely include more sorting algorithms and comparators.
